# LinkedBag_for_Polynomials: A school project for CSCI 235

A LinkedBag implementation to store and carry operations on polynomials of one parameter

For example:
The polynomial -3*x^7 + 4.1 * x^5 + 7 * x^3 + 9 * x^0 can be represented as: 

head_ptr_→ [-3, 7] → [4.1, 5] → [7, 3] → [9, 0] → nullptr

*The degree of the above polynomial is 7.
